description: The purpose of this lesson is to observe how wind can be measured in order to know where wind is most powerful. Students will learn about and construct a simple anemometer, using it to observe the turning power of wind as it depends on wind speed. Minimal prerequisite knowledge is required for this lesson other than a basic understanding of the effects of wind and the uses of its power in every-day life. <br> <a href="lesson_plans/Wind Energy Part II - Lesson.pdf">Wind Energy II Lesson Plan</a>
